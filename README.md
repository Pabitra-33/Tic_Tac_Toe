# Tic_Tac_Toe

- Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Swing and AWT involves several components and functionalities.
  Here's an overview of how you can structure and implement this project:

. GUI Components: You'll use Swing and AWT to create the graphical user interface for the game. This includes buttons for the Tic-Tac-Toe grid and possibly labels for displaying game status or player turns.

. Game Logic: You need to implement the logic of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This includes keeping track of the game state (the positions of Xs and Os on the grid), determining when the game is over (either someone wins or it's a draw), and handling player moves.

. Event Handling: You'll need to handle events when a player clicks on a grid cell to make a move. This involves attaching event listeners to the grid buttons and updating the game state accordingly.
