# Tic_Tac_Toe

Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game application by using Java Programming language with the help of Java AWT and Swing components, that helps me creating 
- Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Swing and AWT involves several components and functionalities.
  
  Here's an overview of how you can structure and implement this project:
* GUI Components: You'll use Swing and AWT to create the graphical user interface for the game. This includes buttons for the Tic-Tac-Toe grid and possibly labels for displaying game status or player turns.

* Game Logic: You need to implement the logic of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This includes keeping track of the game state (the positions of Xs and Os on the grid), determining when the game is over (either someone wins or it's a draw), and handling player moves.

* Event Handling: You'll need to handle events when a player clicks on a grid cell to make a move. This involves attaching event listeners to the grid buttons and updating the game state accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the components and their functionalities:
1. GUI Components:
     - JFrame: This is the main window of your application.
     - JPanel: You can use this to group related components together, such as the Tic-Tac-Toe grid and status labels.
     - JButton: Each cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid can be represented by a button. Clicking on a button corresponds to making a move in that cell.
     - JLabel: You can use labels to display game status messages, such as whose turn it is or the outcome of the game (win, draw, etc.).

2. Game Logic:
     - Game Board Representation: You need to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe grid internally. This could be a simple 2D array where each cell stores the state of the corresponding grid cell 
      (empty, X, or O).
     - Winning Conditions: Implement the logic to check for winning conditions after each move. This involves checking rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive Xs or Os.
     - Player Turns: Keep track of whose turn it is and switch turns after each move.
     - Game Over Detection: Determine when the game is over, either because someone has won or because the board is full (resulting in a draw).

3. Event Handling:
    - Action Listeners: Attach action listeners to the grid buttons to handle player moves.
    - Updating Game State: When a player makes a move, update the internal game state accordingly.
    - Checking Win/Draw: After each move, check if the game is over (either someone has won or it's a draw) and display the appropriate message if so.

Additionally, you can add features like a reset button to start a new game, keeping track of the score, and possibly implementing a simple AI for a single-player mode.
Overall, building a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Swing and AWT involves integrating GUI components with game logic and event handling to create an interactive and functional game.
